# Camera Capture Component Troubleshooting

## Recent Fixes (May 2025)

The camera capture component in the library management system has been enhanced to fix issues where:
1. The camera would initialize (showing "Camera Active" indicator) but the video stream would not be visible (showing only a white box)
2. When clicking "Capture", it would show an error: "No camera stream available. Please restart the camera"

### Key Improvements

1. **Video Element Visibility**
   - Added explicit display styles (`display: block`) to ensure video element is visible
   - Set fixed width/height and object-fit properties to ensure proper rendering
   - Added video stream status indicators for better debugging

2. **Stream Initialization**
   - Improved initialization sequence with retries and better error handling
   - Added track-specific error listeners to handle camera disconnection events
   - Enhanced autoplay handling for mobile devices that block automatic video playback

3. **Canvas Capture**
   - Added validation of video dimensions before attempting to capture
   - Added fallback image generation if canvas capture fails
   - Improved mirroring behavior for selfie captures

4. **Error Handling**
   - Added more descriptive error messages with actionable resolutions
   - Added toast notifications for better user feedback
   - Improved fallback to file upload when camera access fails

## Troubleshooting Camera Issues

If users continue to experience camera issues:

1. **Blank Video Display**
   - Check browser console for any errors related to video playback or camera access
   - Verify that user has granted camera permissions in their browser
   - Check if video element is properly receiving the stream (status indicator should be green)

2. **Capture Failures**
   - Check if the video stream has active tracks before capture
   - Verify that the canvas element can properly draw the video frame
   - Consider using file upload as fallback if capture consistently fails

3. **Mobile Device Issues**
   - Use the native camera option on mobile devices when getUserMedia fails
   - Consider enabling HTTP logs to trace upload failures on mobile networks
   - Test on various mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to identify browser-specific issues

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing the following enhancements:

1. Add device selection capability for users with multiple cameras
2. Add image preview and basic editing capabilities before upload
3. Further optimize the component for lower-end mobile devices
4. Add comprehensive error telemetry to identify common failure patterns
