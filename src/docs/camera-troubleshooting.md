# Camera Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Video element not found" Error on Desktop

**Symptoms:**
- Error message says "Video element not found"
- Happens when clicking "Open Camera" button
- Camera doesn't initialize

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the Page**
   - The most common fix is to simply refresh the page
   - This resets the camera components properly
   - Try clicking "Open Camera" again after refresh

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Use Chrome or Firefox for best camera support
   - Ensure your browser is up to date
   - Try a different browser if problems persist

3. **Hardware Check**
   - Verify your camera is properly connected
   - Check if the camera is working in other applications
   - If using a USB camera, try unplugging and plugging it back in

4. **Use Upload Alternative**
   - Click "Upload from Device" instead
   - Select an image from your device

### 2. "getUserMedia is not implemented" Error on Mobile

**Symptoms:**
- Error message mentions "getUserMedia is not implemented"
- Camera doesn't initialize on mobile devices
- Happens even on recent browser versions

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Use a Compatible Browser**
   - On iOS: Safari (iOS 11+) works best
   - On Android: Chrome or Firefox are recommended
   - Avoid in-app browsers (like Facebook, Instagram browsers)

2. **Check Browser Permissions**
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted:
     - iOS: Settings → Safari → Camera → Allow
     - Android: Settings → Apps → [Browser] → Permissions → Camera

3. **Update Your Browser**
   - Ensure you're using the latest version
   - Older browsers may have limited camera API support

4. **Use the Upload Option**
   - Tap "Upload from Device" instead
   - This will use your device's native camera app

5. **Try the Manual Start Button**
   - If you see a "Start Camera" button, tap it
   - This helps with browsers that block autoplay

### 3. Image Upload Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Camera works but image fails to upload
- Error during upload process

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure you have stable internet connectivity
   - Mobile networks can be unreliable in some areas

2. **Image Size and Type**
   - Keep images under 5MB in size
   - JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats are supported
   - Higher resolution images may cause upload issues

3. **Browser Cache**
   - Clear your browser cache and cookies
   - Restart the browser and try again

4. **Server Configuration**
   - For administrators: Check the upload.php script
   - Verify proper permissions on the upload directory
   - Check server logs for any PHP errors
